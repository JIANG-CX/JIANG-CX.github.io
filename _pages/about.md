I'm a Ph.D. student at HKUST [Aerial Robotics Group](https://uav.hkust.edu.hk/) advised by Prof. [Shaojie Shen](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=u8Q0_xsAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao). Previously, I obtained my master's degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University at [IRMV Lab](http://irmv.sjtu.edu.cn/), where I was advised by Prof. [Hesheng Wang](http://irmv.sjtu.edu.cn/wanghesheng).

My research focuses on **crowd-sourced mapping** and **map-based localization** for autonomous driving. Besides, I am passionate about any robotics-related topic, including perception and planning.

If you have any exciting ideas or cooperation intentions, please feel free to contact me at zqiaoac@connect.ust.hk :)
