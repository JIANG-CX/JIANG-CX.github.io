I am a master student in [IRMV Lab](http://irmv.sjtu.edu.cn/) at Shanghai Jiao Tong University advised by Prof. [Hesheng Wang](http://irmv.sjtu.edu.cn/wanghesheng).

My research interests lie in **SLAM(both visual and LiDAR-based)** and **3D detection** for autonomous vehicles and mobile robots. I am very passionate about both research and engineering and willing to collaborate with others.

As a robot enthusiast, from 2016 to the far future, I will always be committed to the research of localization and perception.
