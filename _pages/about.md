I'm currently focusing on my research. Previously, I obtained my masterâ€™s degrees from Shanghai Jiao Tong University at [IRMV Lab](http://irmv.sjtu.edu.cn/), where I was advised by Prof. [Hesheng Wang](http://irmv.sjtu.edu.cn/wanghesheng). Also, I worked as an intern at [DJI](https://www.dji.com) in 2022.

My research focuses on **crowd-soured mapping** and **map-based localization** for autonomous vehicles. In addition to this, I maintain a strong passion for any topic related to robotic perception, including detection and segmentation.

If you have any interesting ideas or cooperation intentions, please feel free to contact me at zqiaoac@connect.ust.hk :)
