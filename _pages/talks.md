# Two-time RoboCon Champion
My team and I won the championship of RoboCon China trial in 2017 and 2018 respectively, and represented China in the Asia-Pacific event. I am mainly responsible for robot localization, control, wireless communication and an APP that can be used for robot debugging and data recording.
