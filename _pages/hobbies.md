I have a deep passion for Chinese traditional arts, particularly Chinese calligraphy. During my undergraduate studies, I had the honor of serving as the department director of the Zhejiang University Student Calligraphy and Painting Club. It is a great joy for me to share that my works have been exhibited at esteemed institutions such as Zhejiang University, Sungkyunkwan University, and Hangzhou Academy of Chinese Painting. I am excited to present a selection of my Chinese calligraphy works here.
