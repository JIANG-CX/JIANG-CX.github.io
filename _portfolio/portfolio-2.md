title: "Autonomous Driving for Semiclosed Environment"
excerpt: "The framework of the program is based on [ORB-SLAM3](https://github.com/UZ-SLAMLab/ORB_SLAM3.git) and integrates other excellent work, such as [VINS-Fusion](https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/VINS-Fusion.git), [pl-slam](https://github.com/rubengooj/pl-slam.git), [Structure-SLAM-PointLine](https://github.com/yanyan-li/Structure-SLAM-PointLine.git), [gf_orb_slam2](https://github.com/ivalab/gf_orb_slam2.git) and [semidense-lines](https://github.com/shidahe/semidense-lines.git). Line features are added to deal with low-texture environments; IMU, wheel encoder are added to deal with lighting variation and motion blur; Some work of [Dr. Zhao](https://github.com/YipuZhao) is referenced for making SLAM cost-efficient.
