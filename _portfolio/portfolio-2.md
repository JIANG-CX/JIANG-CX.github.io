title: "Intelligent Seal-Carving Art-Generation System"
excerpt: "We digitally reproduced the process of design creation and visual presentation of Chinese seal-carving art.
<br>
([Zhejiang University Intelligent seal-carving System](http://www.next.zju.edu.cn/seal/),
<br>
[Seal-carving search and layout system](http://www.next.zju.edu.cn/seal/search_app/)).
<br>
The knowledge base in this study is the Qiushi seal-carving database, which consists of open datasets of images of seal characters and seal stamps. We proposed a seal character-generation method based on visual knowledge and guided by the database and expertise. Further, to create the layout of the seal, we proposed a deformation algorithm to adjust the seal characters and calculate layout parameters from the database and knowledge to achieve an intelligent structure.

I took part in this research group as a research assistant in 2020 and shoulder the task to build Qiushi seal-carving database and generate four fonts（方笔汉印、圆笔汉印、汉细朱、汉满白、仿东吴纪功碑）.
