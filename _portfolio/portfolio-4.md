title: "Semi-supervised 3D detection"
excerpt: "Current detection models in autonomous driving greatly rely on annotated data, which is expensive for the autonomous driving company. To this end, unlabeled large-scale collected data is considered to be exploited in self- or semi-supervised training. In this project, I adopt [SESS](https://github.com/Na-Z/sess), [Mean Teacher](https://github.com/CuriousAI/mean-teacher), [Pseudo-Label](https://github.com/EricArazo/PseudoLabeling) and [3DIoUMatch](https://github.com/THU17cyz/3DIoUMatch-PVRCNN) to my detection model. The picture below is the visualization of the labeled scan and unlabeled scan.

Current detection models in autonomous driving greatly rely on labeled data, which is expensive for the autonomous driving company. To this end, unlabeled large-scale collected data is considered to be exploited in self- or semi-supervised training. In this project, I adopt [SESS](https://github.com/Na-Z/sess), [Mean Teacher](https://github.com/CuriousAI/mean-teacher), [Pseudo-Label](https://github.com/EricArazo/PseudoLabeling) and [3DIoUMatch](https://github.com/THU17cyz/3DIoUMatch-PVRCNN) to my detection model. The pictures below are used to visualize pseudo-label and consistency regularization, respectively.
