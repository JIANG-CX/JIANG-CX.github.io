title: "UAV For Offside Decision in Soccer Competition"
excerpt: "As VAR (Video Assistant Referee) is manual and VAR or high-quality referee is expensive for low-level matches. This project provides a new idea of assisting offside judgment by using the UAV’s top view perspective. In this project, the UAV can fly automatically to track the players and ball to make offside decision with high accuracy and real-time. The main structure are three parts, PC, android app with DJI mobile SDK, and the DJI Mavic Air2. Owing to the fact that DJI Mavic Air2 is not open source, we develop an Android app with DJI Mobile SDK as a relay station which send the motion command from PC to control UAV as well as send the image of UAV to PC.
